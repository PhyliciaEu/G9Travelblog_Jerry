<p>With a reputation of “The Historical Source and Cultural Root of Fuzhou”, Sanfang Qixiang (三坊七巷), or called Three Lanes and Seven Alleys, is the most famous historical block of Fuzhou. It is composed of three lanes and seven lanes, hence the name. Traditional fish-bone architectural style is well-kept on over 270 ancient dwellings there, allowing the visitors to have a glimpse of the past. It is also a paradise for snacks, handicrafts and nightlife.

<p>White Tower (白塔) was built by Wang Shenzhi, the King of old Ancient Fujian of this region, to repay the kindness of his father and brother. <>The tower is named White tower because its outside appearance is coated with white ash layer. The seven-layer Black Tower (乌塔), or called Wu Tower, faces the southeast side of White Tower in a distance. The tower is in black color after weathering, hence the name. The two towers are two landmarks of Fuzhou.

<p>The Ancestral Hall and Museum of Lin Zexu (林则徐公馆) is located close to Sanfang Qixiang. It was built in memory of Lin Zexu, a national hero in China who famously suppressed the importation of opium and sparked the First Opium War. This ancestral hall and museum will introduce you the entire life of him, with his hand-written poems, couplets, scrolls, political engraving board and other relics exhibited.
